What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It adds git metadata so that the repository can be tracked with git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Documents are added from the working directory to the staging area, and
when a commit is made, everything in the staging area is added to the
repository. This offers simple control over what is committed.
